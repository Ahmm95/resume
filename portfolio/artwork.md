## Sand Self Portrait

The classic HB pencil (2009)

I did this drawing during a time in my life when there was a disconnect
between where my environment was pushing me to go and where I wanted to be.
I was weak because I did not yet understand that self confidence should come
from being comfortable with who you are within and not by the things with 
which you have. Because of my weakness I greatly hurt someone I loved. This
drawing is my apology to her.

## Plant on Golden Section

HB Pencil (2011)

How I hide rhythm and harmony into a line drawing. Do you see the 
treble clef?

## Plant

Conte (2011)

It is so easy to look over a plant. They do not posses a brain but 
they are amazing at what they do.

## Cathedral of Bottles

Conte and Photoshop (2011)

What is creativity? Is everything just a remix of something else or is
there more to it? Here, a lot of empty alcohol containers would make
a beautiful roof for a cathedral.

## Sitting Figure

Conte (2011)

In 2011 when I saw down for my very first figure drawing class I was
so nervous I remember my pencil literally slipped from my sweaty 
hands. I was in a class of 20 people, but the model immediately 
recognized that I was new. And then the craziest thing happened,
he walked over and we started talking. I can't even remember what
he said but his words gave me so much comfort. And then I drew one
of the worst figures ever. This one is a lot better :)

## Beauty

Photoshop CS5 (2012)

A great flaw in my character is that I judge poeple based on their 
attractiveness too much. I did this piece to remind myself how much
appearance should mean to me represented by the amount of ink I used.

The right amount of skin, fat, and bone may be great, but they make
0% of your brain which is who you really are.

## MARK NULLA

Photoshop CS5 (2012)
