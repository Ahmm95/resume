## COVER LETTER
Hi stranger. The best interview question I have been asked is "*tell me the story of your life and why you made 
the decisions you made and tell me about how you solved the hardest problems you have faced*”
 
  From middle to high school I was obsessed with drawing. I loved how I could use my imagination to draw anything I wanted. I spent every free moment I had drawing and by 4th grade my parents couldn’t find a teacher that had anything new to teach me so I started copying artwork I thought were masterpieces like M.C. Escher’s tessellations. However growing up in a chinese american family I was forced to play piano everyday and I remember crying at my piano lessons. I felt trapped like I was living in an invisible prison. I wanted to show my parents that you shouldn’t force a child to do something they don’t enjoy and instead should encourage their natural curiosity. This was not the way of the chinese culture but I had to do something so my younger siblings didn’t suffer the same fate. At age 16 I bargained with my parents by saying if I get straight A's for a semester in school they would pay for my art education instead of piano education. They agreed and the summer of my sophomore year of high school I went to the best classical art studio in the world; the Barnstone Studios 414.6 miles away. At the time it was the bravest thing I had ever done and I was scared out of my mind. I had finally found a place where people were better than me at drawing and design and taking it very seriously. Although I was the youngest student there I could not have felt more at home. I was in heaven and it was the first time in my life I spent every waking minute focused on a single goal; to become the best visual artist I could be.  
 
  After I graduated high school I stopped making visual art because I thought I wasn’t really helping anyone besides myself. So I decided to attend Virginia Tech to study engineering because I thought an engineer can help the most number of people at the same time by building something practically useful. But I didn’t really know what type of engineering so I started watching TED videos to figure out what I was most interested in. And after I watched over 300 videos I realized I wanted to do everything. However, one video by Jeff Hawkin’s stood out in particular. This was in 2011 and he talked about how artificial general intelligence(AGI) would change everything. I was hooked because I realized if I could build a machine that was smarter than humans then I could use that machine to solve all of humanity's current problems. I realized that new problems would be created such as “how can you control something smarter than yourself” but I decided that as I continued to code AGI I would figure out a solution when it was more relevant since AGI was still decades away. To help build AGI I chose my major as Computer Science, joined a neuroscience lab, and I taught myself to code a open source brain model based on Numenta’s cortical learning algorithm described in their 2011 white paper. I also took Stanford’s machine learning class and University of Washington’s computational neuroscience class and the more I learned the more I realized how much longer this project was going to take.
  
  While spending all of my free time trying to code an AGI my class grades began to suffer. I really didn’t enjoy learning from the college classroom because everyone was chasing an A instead of trying to solve real world problems. I began to think the quality of classroom teaching was too fast or too slow for almost every student, the cost of college was too high, and that tests mostly didn’t test problem solving ability and created a culture of not wanting to help your peers. I had to do something and dropping out was not an option because I knew it would break my mother’s heart. I had a friend who was uploading comedic videos to YouTube and I realized it made perfect sense for me to upload videos explaining the most difficult concepts right before a test so all of my studying would not be for nothing. By the end of senior year I had made 350+ videos for the hardest CS and Math classes at Virginia Tech and started receiving thousands of comments and emails for how I was helping students across the world enjoy Math and CS and pass their exams. It was then I realized the power of looking for win win situations that benefit all parties. Life was amazing. Then my best friend from high school killed himself. Everything stopped.
  
  I was in shock for awhile but between the random extremes of emotion something slowly began to dawn on me. I remembered that neuroscience taught me all humans have no free will so I couldn’t be mad at others and most importantly not at myself for my best friend’s death. It was his destiny. And now part of mine was to prevent others from killing themselves. I learned that to truly forgive others and yourself you must understand there is no free will.
  
  After graduating college I accepted a high salary job at AppNexus in NYC in advertising to pay off my student loan debt and get into dating since I went on only 1 date throughout high school and college. Dating turned out to be harder than I thought at first because I realized not only did I not know anything about dating but I also had many wrong assumptions about dating. It’s funny to think I was more scared of asking a girl out on date than devoting my life to building AGI but approaching a stranger I met at a bar alone and asking her out turned out to be a lot harder since I didn’t understand the principles of social dynamics and was only doing it because it felt better than online dating. Eventually I saw other guys approaching random girls and clicking with a large percentage of the girls and having an amazing time. The crazy thing was even when he got rejected by a girl he seemed to be perfectly okay. So I approached him, tried to make him laugh and we immediately hit it off. Over the next few months he taught me everything he knew about how to find the right girl for me and after I approached 600+ girls and went on 50+ amazing dates I met my first serious girlfriend on 1st ave and 17th street in Manhattan on Feb. 7th 2016. Life was amazing. Then my friend from work killed herself and I was reminded of my goal to help prevent suicide. Since I was working at an advertising tech company I realized one day that everything is an ad but the majority of ads were bad ads and that’s why everyone hates advertising. So what is a good ad? I defined it as anything that made your life better immediately and in the future and at the right time. For example, people loved specific movies over others because they saw a certain movie at the right time in their life that happened to help them. So I made a series of 18 video ads on YouTube that tried to help people immediately and in the future and at the right time.
  
  After I paid off my student debt and saved up 25k in 1.3 years after college I left my job to travel Europe with my girlfriend and pursue a few passion projects including building AGI full time. During this time I made an observation for how to figure out what is most likely to be true right now I'm calling Hunter’s Principle after by best friend from high school Hunter Smith who killed himself. In our current world of the distraction economy I use it to figure out what is most likely to be true right now. I noticed it because I realized the human brain makes a lot of assumptions which helps you get through the day but also makes you ignorant and live in a lie. For example, if you asked experts how to build an AGI there are three contradictory answers including classical machine learning, Numenta’s approach, and Vicarious’ approach. Everyone in all three different approaches were very smart but biased by their life experiences. So using Hunter’s Principle you can figure out which is most likely to be true by observing the flow of people switching approaches over as long a time as possible. When you do this a lot of people have moved from classical ML to Numenta’s approach and Vicarious’ approach to building AGI but none have gone the other way around. Additionally, two people that use to work at Numenta now worked at Vicarious but not the other way around. This shows that Vicarious most likely has the best approach to building AGI and after I read the founder of Vicarious’ PhD thesis and started to code Viacarious’ approach I realized I had been building AGI inefficiently. I was humbled that I could research a topic for five years and still be very wrong about the most basic ideas. And after watching a video by Elon Musk I realized it was because I was not thinking from first principles. I began to wonder what else I could be wrong about and began thinking about the AGI control problem. After a mentor of mine suggested I read Superintelligence by Nick I realized that building AGI privately or publicly was clearly not safe because you can’t control something that is smarter than yourself so one solution would be to increase human intelligence faster than code based intelligence. If intelligence is defined by an object with the illusion of free will with the ability to predict the future and act on it in a way that is beneficial to itself and others then a neural lace is a great step in the right direction to saving humanity from code based superintelligence.
